## About Me  

I am an Economist by training and Data Scientist in practice, specializing in the intersection of labour, development, and agricultural economics. 

Currently pursuing my PhD in Economics at Osaka University, my research explores how economic structures, labour markets, and agricultural policies shape productivity, food security, and inclusive growth in emerging economies.

With experience as a Senior Research Analyst at Ghana’s Ministry of Food & Agriculture, I have led policy impact evaluations, national agricultural surveys, and econometric modeling to assess the effectiveness of government programs on farmer livelihoods, rural employment, and food systems resilience.

As the Founder & CEO of Russet Consulting, I help businesses and organizations leverage business intelligence, AI tools, and data automation to improve decision-making and drive growth. My consulting and research work bridges the gap between data-driven insights and real-world applications, supporting both policy and business strategy.

My broader research focuses on how policy design and agricultural transformation drive inclusive and sustainable development, applying data-driven analysis to generate insights that bridge academic research, policy evaluation, and real-world solutions.

My research interests include:  
- **Area 1**  
- **Area 2**  
- **Area 3**
